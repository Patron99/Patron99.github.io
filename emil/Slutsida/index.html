            	<section class="start">
                	<h2> Information </h2>
                    <p><b>Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix.</b></p>
                    <p><b>The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One, OS X, and Linux being released in 2016.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to push a ball into their 
                    opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match.</b></p>
                    <p><b>The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online
                    ,including cross-platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions, as well as cross-play between Xbox One and Windows versions.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and adding new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.</b></p>

                    </figure>
                    <h2> Gameplay </h2>
                    <p><b>Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars.</b></p> 
                    <p><b>Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score points,
                     in a way that resembles a soccer game, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby.</b></p> 
                    <p><b>Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. 
                    The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field,
                     use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later.
                     A player may also utilize boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air.
                      Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction,
                      which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.</b></p>
					<p><b>Matches are typically five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point.
                    Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well 	as 	casual and ranked.  Rocket League also includes a competitive ranked online mode,
                    where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank, respectively.
                    The game includes a single-player "season" mode, with the player competing with computer-controlled players.</b></p>
                    <p><b>An update in December 2016 introduced "Custom Training" sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; 
                    players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal over and over.</b></p>

                    <h2> Professional play </h2>
                    <p><b>Soon after release, Rocket League became an officially sponsored eSport, joining ESL.</b></p>
                     <p><b>In September 2015, Major League Gaming (MLG) announced the first season of the Pro Rocket League, which was held in September through early October.
					Psyonix had observed the popularity of Rocket League matches on Twitch.tv and other live streaming platforms, and in February 2016, were looking to use the game more in eSports.</b></p>
 					<p><b>In March 2016, Psyonix announced the first Rocket League Championship Series; the finals took place in August 2016 with a $55,000 prize pool.
 					 The second season of the championship series took place in December 2016 with a $125,000 prize pool.
                     A third series began in March 2017, with the $300,000 prize pool finals taking place in three months later.</b></p>
                      <p><b>Psyonix announced that going forward into 2017, it will use more than $1 million in revenues from the sale 
                      of in-game crates and cosmetic items to fund additional competitive events throughout the year, including smaller competitions 
                      at major gaming conventions and support for community-run competitive events.</b></p>

                      <h2> Developers </h2>
                    <p><b>Psyonix Inc. is an American video game development studio based in San Diego, California.</b></p>
                       <p><b>The company was formed in 2000 by Dave Hagewood, after developing Internet and multimedia software under the name WebSite Machines, and legally incorporated on April 30, 2001.
                        Its first game project was Proteus. In 2004, the company moved from its original Satellite Beach, Florida location to Raleigh, North Carolina,
                           to Cary, North Carolina in 2005, and to San Diego, California in 2009.</b></p>
						<p><b>The company released Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars and Monster Madness: Grave Danger in 2008, 
                        and continued on other projects including contract work for several big-budget titles.
                         The company then worked on Battle-Cars's successor, Rocket League, which became a commercial success for the company,
                          grossing over $70 million. The success of Rocket League caused the company to adjust its business models,
                            where the company would focus on developing their own original games instead of accepting more contract work.</b></p>
